# Introduction

Allen UI is a UI toolkit based on Vue 3 and TypeScript.

The purpose of implementing this UI library is to learn more about Vue 3
to expand my technical knowledge about how to build a component library
and for some personal project use as well.

So I strongly do not recommend you to use this UI library in production.
Read source code for learning purpose.
