# Usage

Learn the basics of using the components.

## Quick Start

Please install the Allen UI component first.

After installation, you can import the components you need in your
project.

```
import { Button } from 'allen-ui'
```

Then you can use the components in your project.

## Vue SFC components

Sample code:

```
<template>
  <div><Button>按钮</Button></div>
</template>
<script>
  import {Button, Tabs, Switch, Dialog} from "allen-ui"
  export default {
    components: {Button}
  }
</script>
```
